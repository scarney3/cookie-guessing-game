+### My Guessing Game
+
+If you know me, you know I love sports and my favorite sport is 
+basketball! And who better to make a guessing game after none other
+than the legendary Michael Jordan! The game starts out by alerting
+the user that a guessing game is about to commence based on Michael
+Jordan's championship rings. The user is then prompted to enter a
+number between 1-10 and see if they can guess the right amount of
+hardware Michael Jordan posseses. The answer to the question is 6
+championship rings. If the user's guess is equal to 6, the message
+that appears is "Wow you got it!". If they guess wrong, the message
+"Nope! Sorry!" comes up. That simple.
